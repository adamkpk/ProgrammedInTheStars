We held meetings every Wednesday to discuss the progress of our project. 

Memorable moment. 

Our first meeting was held on 28th September. 
We were supposed to meet at 1.45, near the hut on the top floor of Curtis Lecture hall. 
Now you may wonder, where that is?
I was the only one who made it in time. When contacting others I found out they had no idea where the hut was. Thanks to the advanced mapping of the 21st century, our first meeting was a success. We became a compatible team from being strangers.

Difficulty

We had difficulty finalizing our projectâ€™s theme. 
Adam was supporting the use of API to make a recipe website, In my opinion, the astrology website suited the most and Rodney was in favour of a number game. 
Combining the Ideas of all we finalized our theme as it is on the website today.

What we learned

We have learned that every opinion matters in a group project. 
Research is the key to success while coding. 
The more research you do the more knowledge you gain. 
Understanding your code is way more important than getting the correct output.
